        <!--I wanted to save a picture of myself in my images folder, but I don't think that's the right thing to do. I pulled this photo from github.  In the 
        future where do I save images?</!-->

        <p>Hello World! I'm currently a student at the UNCC Coding Bootcamp.  I have no experience with coding, so this has been a very challenging program.</p>

        <p>I'm working very hard to learn this material.  My goal, upon completing the course, is to be in a great position to change careers.  I'm currently a Payables Account Manager with Wells Fargo.
          my entire working career has been in the financial services industry and I feel that it's time for a change. </p>

        <p>I'm married with two young daughters whom I love very much and am striving to make a better life for not only myself, but for them.</p>
